# local_rag_chatbot
This project is a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows you to query information from your PDF documents using an LLM locally via Ollama.   It loads PDFs, splits them into chunks, embeds them, stores in a persistent Chroma vector database, and retrieves relevant content when you ask questions.
